								<h2>Information for Students</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Internships are a fantastic way to gain some hands-on work experience. Having good grades is of utmost importance, but landing on an internship is probably more important to get the most out of it.
							  Learning soft skills such as communication, will greatly expand your network of influential people. Speaking of networks, having a group of influential people around will help you greatly in your
							 future. It’s no longer just about the grades; it's also about your reputation as a hard worker, your ability to sweet-talk an interviewer, and your desire to improve yourself. At this fair you can
							 explore the opportunities open to you and take your first step on the career ladder. </p>

								<h2>Intern fair planning tips</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
											<ol>
											  <li>Consider why you want an internship. </li>
											  <li> Construct an effective <a href="https://careercenter.illinoisstate.edu/student/resume/">resume</a></li>
											  <li>Prepare for on-the-spot <a href="https://careercenter.illinoisstate.edu/student/interviewing/">interviews</a>. Visit <a href="http://isu.interviewstream.com/">InterviewStream</a> to get interview questions listed by major and job industry, and practice your answers.</li>
											  <li>Identify your answers to commonly asked questions. </li>
												<li>Be sure to customize your resume for each interview opportunity. Nothing screams “lazy” like a generic resume and cover letter! </li>
												<li>A good rule of thumb is that it’s always better to overdress than underdress, so don’t worry if you seem more professional than the other candidates.</li>
												<li>Prepare your elevator speech beforehand, which should detail who you are, what your goals are and why you are a great candidate for the internship.
													Having an elevator speech ready before your interview can make the difference between an awkward moment and a defining moment within your career.
												</li>
